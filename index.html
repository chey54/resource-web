        <h1>Impressionism</h1>
        <br>
        <dd>Impressionism is a revolutionary 19th-century art movement that transformed the way artists captured the world around them. Originating in France during the 1860s, Impressionist painters broke away from traditional techniques by using visible brushstrokes, vibrant colors, and a focus on light and movement. Rather than creating highly detailed, realistic works, they aimed to capture fleeting moments and everyday life, often painting outdoors (plein air) to observe how natural light changed their subjects.</dd>
